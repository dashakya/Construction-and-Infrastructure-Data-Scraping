All existing structures on the site would be demolished, although two of the three existing driveways would be preserved. The proposed use totals 144,808 square feet with first-floor office space of 4,750 square feet and an Office Mezzanine of 4,245 square feet, for a total building area of 153,803square feet. The warehouse would have 24 loading docks, located at the eastern end of the building. The floor area ratio (FAR) would be 0.44, and the building height would be 43 feet.\\nProject Location\\nThe project site is located at 731 West Cutting Boulevard in the City of Richmond. The 7.94-acre project site consists of a developed industrial site with access from two driveways along West Cutting Boulevard and one driveway along Canal Boulevard. The site is bounded to the north by Interstate 580 (I-580), with Canal Boulevard on the west and West Cutting Boulevard on the south.

Continual coastal wave and tidal action is causing a loss of park area; the coastal erosion is more prominent and severe at the north end of Beach Park, where the bluff is higher. Severe undercutting is present near the broken culvert located near the northern end of the project area. The erosion is also threatening the alignment of the approved San Francisco Bay Trail (Bay Trail). Left unchecked, this erosion will continue to encroach upon the Bay Trail route, park facilities, trees, cultural resources, and open space. To protect existing recreational facilities and transportation infrastructure located along the shoreline, the proposed project would construct revetments required to support coastal-dependent uses (public beaches, the bike/pedestrian trail, and shoreline public park).\\nCity of Richmond has prepared a draft Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration for environmental review of the following described project in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) of 1970, as amended, and the City of Richmond\\u2019s Guidelines and Procedures for Implementation of CEQA.\\nReview and Comment Period:\\nComments on the MND shall be sent in writing and must be received by\\n5:00 p.m. on November 9, 2020\\n, at the following address or email:\\nLina Velasco\\nCity of Richmond\\nCommunity Development Department\\n450 Civic Center Plaza,\\u00a0P.O.
